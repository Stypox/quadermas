Features:
- Add a popup in the login screen that allows searching the school id in a list of all schools that use Mastercom. Loading such list from Mastercom servers is slow, though.

Improvements:
- Improve handling login errors when the school id is invalid, or when the user has no subjects
- Improve the code in various places
- Update some libraries
- Increase targetSdk from 30 to 31
